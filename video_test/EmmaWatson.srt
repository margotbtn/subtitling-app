00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome ESL students. I'm your guide for today. We're

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
going to analyze and empowering speech by the renowned actress and activist Emma Watson Emma

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
a native English speaker delivers this

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
speech with great eloquence her communication style Rich

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
vocabulary and grammar usage

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
provide an excellent learning platform for us. Are you ready to explore

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and learn? Let's get started.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I was appointed

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
as Goodwill Ambassador

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
for un women's six months ago.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And The more I've spoken about

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
feminism. The more I have

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
realized that fighting for women's rights.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Has too often become synonymous. with

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
man hating

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
if there is one thing

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I know for certain.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It is that this

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
has

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
to stop.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Emma Begins by sharing her experience as a Goodwill Ambassador for un women

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
notice the use of the past simple tense. I was

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
appointed which we use for completed actions

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
in the past. She also uses the conjunction and to

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
connect her ideas.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
for the record feminism by

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
definition is the

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
belief that men and women should have equal

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
rights and opportunities.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It is the theory

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
of the political

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
economic and

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
social equality of the sexes.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
In this segment Emma provides a clear definition of feminism

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
a term that is often misunderstood. The

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
term feminism is an example of a compound noun, which is a noun made up of

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
two or more words. In this case feminism is derived from female and

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
the suffix ism which indicates a practice system or

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
ideology. I started questioning gender-based assumptions a long time ago.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
When I was eight.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I was confused being called bossy.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Because I

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
wanted to direct the plays that we would put on for our parents. But

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
the boys were

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
When at 14 I

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
started to be sexualized by certain elements of the media.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
When it's 15,

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
my girlfriend started dropping out of their beloved sports teams.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Because they didn't want to appear

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Emma shares her personal experiences using the past simple tense I started. This tense

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
is used for actions that began and ended in the

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
past. She also uses the conjunction when to introduce a specific time in the

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
past one at

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
18. My male

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
friends were unable to express their

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I decided. That

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I was a feminist.

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And this seemed uncomplicated to me.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But my recent research

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
has shown

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
me. That feminism has become an unpopular word.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
women

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Are choosing

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
not

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to identify

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
as feminist?

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
apparently

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I am among the ranks of

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
women whose expressions are

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
seen as too strong.

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
too aggressive

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
isolating

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and anti-men

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
unattractive even

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Emma continues her personal experiences again using the conjunction when to introduce a

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
specific time in the past. She

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
also uses the phrase

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I am

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
among which is a present tense phrase used to indicate inclusion

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
in a

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
group. Why has

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
the word

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
become such an uncomfortable one.

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I am from Britain.

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And I think it is

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
right that I am paid the same as my male counterparts.

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I think it is right

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
that I should be able to make decisions about my own

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
body. I think it

90
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
is, right. That women be

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
involved on my behalf

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
in the policies and the decisions that will affect my life.

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I think it is

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
right. That's socially

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I am afforded the same respect as men.

96
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Emma questions the discomfort around the term feminism

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
notice the use of the question word

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
why which we use to

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
ask for reasons? She also uses the present simple

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
tense. I think to

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
express her opinions,

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
but sadly. I

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
can say that there is no one country in the

104
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
world where all

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
women can expect to receive these rights.

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No country in the world

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
can yet say

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
that they have achieved agenda equality.

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Emma uses the conjunction

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,000
but

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
to introduce a contrasting point. She

112
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
also uses the modal verb can to talk about ability or possibility.

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Modal verbs are a type of auxiliary verb that expressed necessity possibility permission or ability in this

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
case can

115
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
is used to express possibility indicating

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
that it's possible but not certain.

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Thank you very

118
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Emma ends her speech with a polite

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
expression. Thank you. Very

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000

121
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
