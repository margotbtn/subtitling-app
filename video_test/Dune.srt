00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What did you see?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Is Crusade coming?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Do you often dream things that happen just as you dream them. Yes.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The test is simple.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Remove your hand from the box.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And you die.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You inherit too much power.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You have proven you can rule yourself.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000


14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now you must learn to rule others something none of your ancestors learned.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
My father rules an entire planet, he's losing it.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
He's getting a richer one.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
He'll lose that.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Right. Iraqis is a death trap.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is an extermination.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Taking my family off one by one.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's fight my demons.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
An animal called in a trap will nor off its own leg to escape.[ASR not working]

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What will you do?

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000


26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000


27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Legends will be born.

Hello Duke.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
For the fear is gone.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
